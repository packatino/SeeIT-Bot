# SeeIT Twitter Bot

This repository contains a bot written in Python. The bot checks Twitter for new tweets with the hashtag `seeit_kn` and retweets those tweets with the official [SeeIT Twitter account](https://twitter.com/seeit_kn). The bot is our example project for the meetup [Building a Twitter Bot for SeeIT](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/SeeIT-IT-Meetup-in-Konstanz-Kreuzlingen/events/243325206/?eventId=243325206).

I have also written a tutorial which explains how to build a Twitter bot. You can find it on https://team-coder.com/twitter-bot-with-python

And now enjoy playing with the code! If you want to improve it feel free to create a pull request! :octocat:
